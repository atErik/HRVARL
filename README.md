Civilized society makes sure there are restrictions on everything & everyone , so that excessive power/ability/money, etc are not abused or used for harm/steal/kill, etc.  
History can always show, unchecked/unrestricted power/ability/money,etc is always (very) harmful.  
<br />
<br />
<br />

On the other hand/side , if you do not care about violations or abuses of Human-Rights , or you want to support more violations of Human-Rights and more abuses of Human-Rights , then you may use GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses for your SHIDSP (software/hardware/info/data/service/project) . These (GPL, MIT, BSD, etc) licenses do not prohibit user from using the SHIDSP for violating or abusing Human-Rights , so these (GPL, MIT, BSD, etc) licenses & pushers of these licenses are actually helping to increase violations & abuses of Human-Rights around the world & in your locality/country . Abusers & violators like to use these (GPL, MIT, BSD, etc) licenses & SHIDSP , their pushers want you to join+help them to develop under those license , so that thier buddies (or they themselves) can use those SHIDSP for more Human-Rights violations & abuses , they can do these violations & abuses easily because these (GPL, MIT, BSD, etc) licenses do not have clear restriction/prohibition on Human-Rights violations or abuses.
