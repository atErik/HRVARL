On the other hand/side , if you do not care about violations or abuses of Human-Rights , or you want to support more violations of Human-Rights and more abuses of Human-Rights , then you may use GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses for your SDSP (software/data/service/project) . These GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses do not prohibit user from using the SDSP for violating or abusing Human-Rights , so these GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses & pushers of these licenses are actually helping to increase violations & abuses of Human-Rights around the world+ . Abusers & violators like to use these GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses & software/service/project , their pushers want you to join+help them to do more Human-Rights violations & abuses , as these GPL, MIT, BSD, etc licenses do not have clear restriction/prohibition on Human-Rights violations or abuses.
